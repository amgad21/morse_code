# morse_code
This Python script translates text into Morse code and vice versa, utilizing a predefined Morse code dictionary. The dictionary includes mappings for letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and a space character.

Features
Morse to Text Translation: Converts Morse code input into readable text.
Text to Morse Translation: Transforms text input into Morse code.
Binary to Morse and Text: Converts binary input into Morse code and then translates it into text.
User Interaction: Accepts user input for translation and provides the corresponding Morse code, binary representation, and translated text.
Usage
Run the script.
Enter the text you want to translate to Morse code when prompted.
The script will output the Morse code, binary representation, and translated text.

Morse Code Dictionary
The Morse code dictionary is defined at the beginning of the script, mapping characters to their respective Morse code representations.

Note
The script accounts for spaces between words in Morse code and uses a standard mapping for Morse code characters.

Dependencies
This script requires Python 3.
